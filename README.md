# Analysis of the `$K_S^0K_S^0` at GlueX

This repository contains all of the code required to run the analysis performed for my thesis. Most of it can be executed from the `Justfile` commands, but only if the data paths in `dselector.py` are valid. They also assume a cluster with enough RAM to power the analysis, coordinated by SLURM with partitions named "blue" and "green", although the partition names are only used in the `slurm_job_<partition>.sh` files. Additionally, this analysis takes up about 438GB on disk if the entire thing is run with `chisqdof` set to `2.00`, `3.00`, `4.00`, and `5.00`, which were the cuts used in the analysis. The default cut of `3.00` runs some additional plots and analyses that the others do not, and there are also some plots which were not used in the thesis but are located in this repository.
